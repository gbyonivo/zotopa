## PROBLEMS running on CODESANDBOX!!!!

IN THE SRC/API/SERVICE there is an option to use firebase uncomment the above commented code and comment the one below to use firebase.

I have tried running this application on codesandbox but it will only work after I have made a change to the files. Any change I make will force the project to start (include adding space anywhere or even just deleting semi colons). Before that it shows an error related to the firebase client module I am using. and even shows errors with redux-sagas/effect.
